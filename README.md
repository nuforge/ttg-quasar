> **Production-ready tabletop gaming platform built with Vue 3, Quasar Framework, and Firebase**

## 🎯 **Overview**

The TTG (Tabletop Gaming) Quasar Application is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade web application that provides a complete platform for managing tabletop gaming events, players, games, and community interactions.

### ✨ **Key Features**

- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** - Firebase Auth with role-based access control
- 🎮 **Game Management** - Comprehensive game catalog and ownership tracking  
- 📅 **Event Management** - Event creation, RSVP, and calendar integration
- 👥 **Player Management** - User profiles, preferences, and social features
- 💬 **Messaging System** - Real-time messaging between players
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard** - Complete administrative interface
- 🌐 **Internationalization** - Multi-language support (English/Spanish)
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first, PWA-ready
- 🛡️ **Enterprise Security** - Production-ready security implementation

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 LTS (recommended), or a supported even-numbered release starting at 22.22.0
- npm or yarn
- Firebase CLI
- Git

GitHub Actions tests Node.js 22.22+ and 24, builds and deploys with Node.js 24,
and uses Ubuntu 24.04 runners.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ttg-quasar

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Firebase configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Build & Deploy

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy
```

`npm run build` first checks public assets and refuses to publish private keys.
Firebase Admin service-account files must stay outside `public/`; use environment
credentials for server-side tooling. If a key has been uploaded or deployed,
revoke it in Google Cloud IAM before deploying again.
